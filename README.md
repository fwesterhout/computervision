Abstract Blog:

In this blog, we propose a neural network architecture that is able to differentiate whether people are wearing face masks in a real-time setting. This can be potentially used to monitor if individuals are not wearing face masks in a crowd, which can be useful for many different applications, like research on contagiousness of the virus and supervision. An approach is shown how to practically train and test a neural network model with a non-standard self-augmented dataset in the topic of image recognition in computer vision. The steps taken considering the choice of the network architecture, the processing and ordering of the data and the implementation and results of the training process are shown.
